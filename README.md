# ICVR-Unity 

Welcome to the ICVR template, for building Unity scenes on the Internet Computer. This template, which should be considered a work in progress, provides both Unity and WebAuthn contexts, helps to pass in-game functions to endpoints on the web or blockchain. It is configured to use Internet Identity, a WebAuthn solution configured for the Internet Computer, and provides a secure context to pass messages to the blockchain, enabling crypto transactions and secure messaging. 

## üì¶ Create a New Project

Make sure that [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) `>= 16` and [dfx](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/developer-docs/build/install-upgrade-remove) `>= 0.14` are installed on your system.

Beginning with a new, empty project directory:

- Import the project and start dfx with the following commands:

```sh
npx degit willguest/icvr-react # Download this starter project
dfx start --clean --background # Run dfx in the background
```

Add the Unity build:
  - Currently only supports uncompressed builds. Support for gzip will be added soon
  - Make sure the Unity build was called `unity_build`. If another name is used, update `UnityInterface.tsx`.
  - Place the files in `src/assets/build`.

Run the following commands, which can also be found in the *NPM SCRIPTS* sidebar.

```sh
npm run setup # Install packages, deploy canisters, and generate type bindings
npm run build # Compiles TypeScript files and builds the webpack.
npm run start # Deploys local dependency canisters and runs the front- and back-end in parallel.
```

You can then open a new browser window at location prompted by the terminal
  `http://127.0.0.1:4943/?canisterId=<local-canister-id>`

When ready, run `dfx deploy --network ic` to deploy your application to the Internet Computer.

## üí° Tips and Tricks

- Customize your project's code style by editing the `.prettierrc` file and then running `npm run format`.
- Reduce the latency of update calls by passing the `--emulator` flag to `dfx start`.
- Install a Motoko package by running `npx ic-mops add <package-name>`. Here is a [list of available packages](https://mops.one/).
- Split your frontend and backend console output by running `npm run frontend` and `npm run backend` in separate terminals.
